            </h2>

            <article class="article1">
            My name is Oluwakemisola Sophia Bakare. My journey into Frontend Engineering began with a passion for nurturing young minds 
            and fostering a love for learning.<br> With a background in Early Years Montessori education, I have spent years honing my skills as a guide, creating environments that promote independence, curiosity, and self-discovery. 
            <br>Throughout my career, I have witnessed the transformative impact of personalized learning on children's development, 
            instilling in me a deep-seated belief in the power of education to unlock human potential. <br> <br>
   
            However, as I navigated the landscape of traditional education, I became increasingly aware of the disparities that exist 
            in access to quality learning experiences.<br>Inequities in resource allocation, geographic limitations, and socioeconomic 
            barriers all served to hinder the realization of every child's right to education.<br>It was this realization that sparked my 
            journey into front-end engineering, as I sought to leverage technology as a tool for educational innovation and social change. 
            <br>By combining my educational expertise with technical skills, I am dedicated to creating digital solutions that bridge gaps 
            in education and provide equitable learning 
            opportunities for all.

    <p>My educational and career aspirations have always been driven by a commitment to empowering children and fostering a
       love for learning. Through my transition into front-end engineering,<br> I aim to expand my skill set and deepen my 
       understanding of technology's potential to revolutionize education.<br> Specifically, I aspire to create an interactive
      virtual Montessori classroom that breaks down geographical and socioeconomic barriers, 
      providing equal access to quality education for all children.</p>
